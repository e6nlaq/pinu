Text of heaven and earth - Yukichi Fukuzawa

Sun and moon. North, south, east and west.
With your back to the north, face south and point right and left.
The morning rises gradually from the east, and the sun sets again in the evening.
Dividing the realms day and night without change, morning and afternoon, twenty-four hours before and after, collect time and count the days,
If the number of thirty days is filled, one month, regardless of whether it is large or small, divide the outline into four weeks,
The names of the days of the week are Sun, Mon, Tues, Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sat, and the 17th is renewed.
The beginning of spring is still late, the first third month, spring, summer, autumn, winter, three months each, a total of 360 days,
Year after year, year after year, 100 years, 36,000 days, a life of only 50 years.
